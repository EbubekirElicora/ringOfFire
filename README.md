# Ring of Fire

Interactive web-based card game inspired by the classic “Ring of Fire”.
The project focuses on clean game logic, structured state management and real-time interaction using modern web technologies.


## Overview

Ring of Fire is a browser-based card game where players draw cards and trigger predefined game rules.
The application was developed as a Single Page Application with a clear separation between UI, game logic and data handling.

The project demonstrates how interactive game mechanics can be implemented with maintainable, scalable code instead of ad-hoc scripting.


## Purpose

This project was built to:

- deepen my understanding of event-driven game logic
- practice structured state management
- work with real-time data using Firebase
- build a complete application from concept to finished product

It represents a practical, non-trivial JavaScript / TypeScript project rather than a simple demo.


## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- Angular
- TypeScript
- HTML5
- SCSS
- Component-based architecture
- Responsive layout for different screen sizes

### Backend / Services
- Firebase Firestore
- Real-time data synchronization
- Basic access control via Firestore rules

### Tooling
- Git & GitHub
- npm
- Angular CLI

## Architecture

- Clear separation of UI, game rules and data handling
- Centralized game state management
- Reusable components for cards and player interactions
- Predictable update cycle for game flow and UI updates
- Focus on readability and long-term maintainability

## Features

- Interactive card drawing
- Rule-based game logic
- Real-time game state updates
- Responsive UI for desktop and mobile
- Clean and minimalistic user interface


## What I Learned

Developing Ring of Fire strengthened my ability to build interactive applications with clean, event-driven logic.
I designed the entire game architecture independently, separating UI, gameplay rules and data flow into maintainable modules.
Working with Firebase improved my understanding of real-time updates and asynchronous state handling.
The project helped me write clearer TypeScript, structure features more predictably and translate complex behavior into stable, scalable code.
